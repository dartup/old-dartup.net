    <h1>Dart shared hosting alpha.</h1>
    <p>I asked the community what service they first wanted Dartup to deliver
        and shared hosting won by a landslide. So to that goal i invite you to
        join me in making Dartup the best host for development and small
        projects.
    </p>
    <p>Now at the beginning i focus mostly on getting a number of projects
        working on a single server. Luxury  items like a control panel is lite
        later. So its mostly a you give me a git url and i will pull and host
        it. I also have written a <a href="https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/dartup">dartup package</a> that will make it easy to have
        the same server running on Dartup and locally.
    </p>
    <h3>Hello world example</h3>
    <pre>
import 'dart:io';
import 'package:dartup/dartup.dart' as dartup;
main() async{
  // Gets a HttpServer. We just use the default values localhost:8080 for local runs.
  HttpServer server = await dartup.bind();
  server.listen((HttpRequest req){
    req.response.write('Hello world');
    req.response.close();
  });
}
    </pre>
    You can find a more complete example over at: <a href="https://github.com/dartup/hello">https://github.com/dartup/hello</a>
    <h3>Terms of service:</h3>
    <p><strong>Respect that is alpha.</strong> This is very early alpha so it
        not feature complete stable or secure. So don't expect it to be. So if
        you use Dartup for private project or anything even close to production
        it on your own risk. As its not really fit for any purpose.
    </p>
    <h3>Technical requirements:</h3>
    As this is an early alpha your application need to make some small adaptations:
    <ul>
        <li>The code must be publicly available so that I can git clone it.</li>
        <li>You should use the
            <a href="https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/dartup">Dartup package</a>
            to get port information.</li>
        <li>The service right now starts bin/server.dart without arguments.</li>
        <li>At this point there is no support for build tools.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>How to sign up.</h3>
    You only need to contact me with the following information:
    <ul>
        <li>The name you want for your project. name.dartup.io.</li>
        <li>The git url to your project.</li>
        <li>Any environmental variables you want to pass along to your application. Like database credentials.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Contact info.</h3>
    <p>I am <a href="https://plus.google.com/+OleMartinGjersvik">+OleMartinGjersvik</a> on Google+<br>
    I am <strong>jerweb</strong> over at <a href="https://dartlang.slack.com">dartlang.slack.com</a> You can get an invite at
    <a href="https://dartlang-slack.herokuapp.com/">https://dartlang-slack.herokuapp.com/</a>.<br>
    Or just mail me at <a href="mailto:olem@olem.org">olem@olem.org.</a>
    </p>
    <h3>Q&A</h3>
    <p><strong>What databases/datastores are supported?</strong><br>
        None yet. But you can host MongoDB for free over at <a href="https://mongolab.com/">mongolab.com</a> and if you
        select Amazon Web Services EU (Ireland) region the database will be nice and close to Dartup alpha. If you
        search around you will find lots of services that offer free and or cheap database hosting on Amazon. And there
        is always <a href="https://www.firebase.com/">firebase</a>.</p>
    <p><strong>I do not feel comfortable just telling you my database credentials.</strong><br>
        Then donâ€™t. This extremely early alpha and that there is a good hint that your application is not meant for Dartup
        yet. I hope to see your business in the future when the platform is a bit more secure and stable.</p>
    <p><strong>What do i do if i want to change some settings?</strong><br>
        Contact me. It serves me right for not having a control panel yet.</p>
    <p><strong>Do I have any file access?</strong><br>
        Yes and no. You have full read write access to your own home directory. But what you store is not persistent over
        time. I will look into it but in the short term there will be a lot of nuking.</p>
    <p><strong>How do i keep updated on Dartup?</strong><br>
        For low traffic about once a week the <a href="http://blog.dartup.net/">blog.dartup.net</a>.<br>
